The Arithmetic Origin of the Fine Structure Constant: A Technical Summary
1. Introduction: The Alpha Mystery and the Arithmetic Hypothesis
The fine-structure constant (
α
α) is a fundamental dimensionless parameter of the Standard Model, quantifying the strength of electromagnetic interaction. Its measured inverse, according to CODATA 2022, is:

α

.
α 
−1
 =137.035999206(11).
Traditionally treated as an empirical parameter, the Theory of Fundamental Arithmetization proposes that 
α
α emerges from a discrete, information-processing vacuum—a consequence of topological geometry and informational impedance in a modular substrate.

2. The Informational Substrate: Modular Symmetry and Impedance
The theory identifies the cyclic ring 
Z
/

Z
Z/6Z as the vacuum’s fundamental symmetry. This choice stems from the Standard Model gauge group

From an information perspective, the ring filters signal channels (coprimes 1 and 5) from noise channels (divisors 0, 2, 3, 4). Applying the Landauer Principle, this filtering incurs an entropic cost, leading to the definition of the fundamental impedance:

The derivation exhibits low Kolmogorov complexity, obtaining a 14‑digit constant from a minimal arithmetic set.

7. Conclusion: Implications for Physics
The fine‑structure constant emerges as a consequence of information geometry, not an arbitrary input. Its value is fixed by:

Entropic correction (
1

Geometric screening (

(

Modular symmetry (

α to the algebraic center of the Standard Model gauge group.

This framework unifies number theory and thermodynamics, suggesting that fundamental constants are exact outcomes of the discrete arithmetic of the vacuum.
